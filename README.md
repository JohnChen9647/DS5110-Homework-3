# DS5110 Homework 3 — MovieLens 100K

## Project Overview

This is a collaborative project for DS5110. The project explores the MovieLens 100K dataset and uses Python, pandas, and SQLite for data processing, database design, and analysis.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [GroupLens MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)
- **Download URL:** https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip
- **Dataset:** 100,000 ratings, 943 users, and 1,682 movies
- **SHA-256 (local ZIP):** `50d2a982c66986937beb9ffb3aa76efe955bf3d5c6b761f4e3a7cd717c6a3229`

The raw dataset and generated SQLite database are excluded from Git.

## Download Instructions

Run the following command from the project root:

```bash
python src/download.py
```

This script downloads the dataset, extracts it into `data/raw/ml-100k/`, and prints its SHA-256 checksum.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/` — Exploratory data analysis
- `src/` — Data downloading and loading scripts
- `sql/` — Database schema and SQL queries
- `output/` — Generated reports and validation outputs

## Team Collaboration

Team members will work on separate Git branches and submit pull requests for review before merging into `main`.

## AI Assistance

ChatGPT was used for explanations, debugging guidance, and assistance with code structure and documentation. All generated suggestions should be reviewed and tested by the team.

## Status

Work in progress. Initial data exploration and dataset download functionality have been implemented.
